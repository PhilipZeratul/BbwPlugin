# BbwPlugin
This is a porting of Unity Anima2D's dll for calculating bone weights to iOS.

Anima2D is a Unity plugin for 2D skeleton animation.
But Anima2D can only be used in Unity Editor and the calculation of bone weights part is stored in a .dll that cannot be used on iOS.
This porting is for this bone weight calculation part to work on iOS.
Together with my previous work, Anima2D is fully functional on iOS at runtime.
